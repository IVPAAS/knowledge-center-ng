<span> </span>

<span>_______________________________________________________________________________________</span>

<span>Integrating your Ad Server with the KMC is a one-time activity performed when you initially set up video advertising. The ad server has to be VAST compliant or available as a Kaltura plugin. You may also create a custom swf for the Kaltura Player to support. After you have selected an ad server and set up an account with that ad server, you integrate the ad server with the KMC by establishing a connection between that ad server and KMC. After the connection is established, all ad requests generated by the Kaltura Dynamic Player are in a format which the ad server expects, allowing seamless communication between the Kaltura Player and the ad server. The Digital Video Ad Serving Template (VAST) is an industry standard for the XML response from an ad server.</span>

<span>Most of the leading Ad Servers and Ad Networks are VAST compliant, and support IAB standard Advertising and Ad Networks Kaltura Management Console (KMC) User Manual 223 (VAST 1.0 / VAST 2.0 and VAST 3.0). Popular ad servers include DoubleClick, Dart For Publisher (DFP), Microsoft Atlas, OpenX, ScanScout. To see the full list of servers and networks that comply with VAST </span>refer to the IAB website: [http://www.iab.net/iab\_products\_and\_industry\_services/508676/compliance/679253][1]

 [1]: http://www.iab.net/iab_products_and_industry_services/508676/compliance/679253

<span>In general, ads, tracking, scheduling, and other parameters, are configured on the ad server side. With VAST, other parameters need to be configured through the KMC or Kaltura Player. Ad parameters are configured through the Studio tab in the KMC. </span>

<span> </span>

<span></span>

<span>_______________________________________________________________________________________</span>

Kaltura partners have the ability to create a custom .swf file to stream ads from their own ad server to the Kaltura Player. The.swf file acts as an ad plugin. The configured key-value pairs must be defined to play the relevant ads. You have to subscribe to an ad server and configure the ads on the ad server side. For more information refer to the link [More information][2].

<span><strong>Ad tracking</strong> – the ability to define which/if ads play based on specific metadata.</span>

<span><strong>Overlay</strong> – an ad that appears as an image (usually with text) over a video, while the video is playing.</span>

<span><strong>Companion ad</strong>– a banner ad that accompanies the ad that plays over the video player – this can either be located in the list area of the playlist or somewhere else on the HTML page.</span>

<span><strong>Ad Tag URL</strong> – a URL that is XML that contains all the information about the ad(s) that should be displayed. VAST works with an ad tag URL system. The XML needs to conform to VAST standard in order to be considered “VAST-compatible”. That means that it needs to have the proper tags.</span>

<span>The following is an example of a VAST ad tag URL: http://ad3.liverail.com/?LR_PUBLISHER_ID=1331&LR_CAMPAIGN_ID=229&LR_SCHEMA=vast2</span>

<span>To see the example, insert this URL into your browser. Ad Cue Points – time based points on an entry that can be used to view mid- roll advertisements.</span>

<span>Tremor Media is an ad network that acts as a connector between ad companies/servers and their customers. Tremor Media connects with numerous ad sources and partners from a single control center and works with their customers to provide the appropriate ads from the appropriate ad servers. </span>

      <span>While ads targeting is performed within the ad server, Kaltura’s VAST advertising module is designed to pass all the relevant targeting information to the ad server. Targeting information can be set in several levels:</span>
    </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span>Targeting per player and ad slot – you can add additional key value pairs within the adtag URL.</span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>The ad server will use these for targeting.</span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Targeting per content item - The Kaltura VAST module supports dynamic pulling of metadata from the content item, and passes it to the ad server.</span>
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
