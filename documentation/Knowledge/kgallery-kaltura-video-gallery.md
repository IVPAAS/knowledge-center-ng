Web site designers may want to add a Gallery component to their web pages so that end-users can browse through a large set of media files and conveniently select the media they want to view.Â   
Kaltura Gallery (KGallery) services enable an efficient visual display of media files, hosted on a Kaltura-based system, enabling the following functionality:

<ul class="bb-list">
  <li>
    Media filtering
  </li>
  <li>
    Paging management
  </li>
  <li>
    Integration with other media components upon user interaction
  </li>
</ul>

## GUI Screenshots

Kaltura Gallery services are not limited to a specific graphic layout for element browsing; the services simply provide the ability to populate the various layouts with content elements hosted on a Kaltura-based system.  
The examples shown below implement the following layouts:

<ul class="bb-list">
  <li>
    A static HTML table based layout<br /><img src="{{site.url}}/assets/428">
  </li>
  <li>
    A dynamic scrollable layout<br /><a href="http://knowledge.kaltura.com/sites/default/files/kgalleryScrollable.zip"><img src="{{site.url}}/assets/426">
  </li>
</ul>
