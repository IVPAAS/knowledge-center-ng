    My Media
  </h2>
  
  <p>
    My Media is a repository of single <em>user</em>’s media, where each user has a personal searchable repository for viewing and managing private media content. Media items within My Media may be added to sites and inline text item, based on the user’s enrollment.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    User’s My Media content is shared and consistent across all Kaltura applications (for example, Kaltura MediaSpace) in use by the institution and serves as the basis for cross campus suite.

    [collapsed title="Kaltura Media Gallery"]
  </p>
  
  <h2>
    Kaltura Media Gallery
  </h2>
  
  <p>
    The Kaltura Media Gallery is a searchable gallery of media content of a <em>specific site</em>. The Media Gallery does not necessarily include all media that is used within the site in other contexts. Instead, the Media Gallery contains the content that was deliberately assigned to it.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The Kaltura Media Galley is intended to be used as a media syllabus for a site, as a social media repository of the site or in some cases for media assignments. The Kaltura Media Gallery may be used simultaneously with media in context, as a standalone or not at all, depending on how the teacher and school prefer to use it.

  <h2>
    Creating a Video Clip
  </h2>
  
  <p>
    When clipping is enabled on the account and for the specific media, you can create clips from existing videos. Each clip becomes its own media entry. The clipping tool enables you to edit your videos visually or by setting the start time and end time of your clip.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Clipping creates a new entry from an existing entry and allows you to specify the start and end time for the new entry. For example you can clip an entry that can be used to create a 2 minute intro video to a long lecture, or clip part of an entry, such as homework assignments. You can also clip a long lecture to several shorter clips divided by subjects.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Entries can be clipped by the media entry owner in My Media and by other users in a course Media Gallery, according to the media and course settings.
  </p>
  
  <p class="Procedure mce-procedure">

  <h2>
    <a name="trimming"></a>Trimming a Video

  <p>
    You can trim out parts of video from the Edit Media page. The trimming tool enables you to edit your videos visually by setting the start time and end time of your media.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Sometimes, you may want to trim the start and/or end of a video to remove redundant parts. Trimming is performed on the source media, modifying that video permanently.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If the clipping functionality is enabled, media items that you own or media items that are marked as clippable and are in a collection or site library, can be clipped by users with the <a href="https://kaltura.sharepoint.com/community-team/Shared%20Documents/Knowledge%20Management/Work%20in%20Progress/KAF/LTI/User_Guide/KAF%20LTI%20User%20Guide.docx#_Item_Permissions">correct permissions</a>.

    Managing Chapters and Slides in the Timeline Tab
  </h2>
  
  <p>
    Chapters are like bookmarks in the video and can be used to navigate through the video. You can use chapters to mark the beginning of a new topic, highlight important segments, or help navigate through the content of a long video. You can add, edit, and delete chapters and slides in the Timeline tab. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    A Slide is a synchronized visual element to the main media.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    After chapters and slides are created, the player is displayed with a matching plugin that presents the chapters and slides view on it.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    A viewer only sees the extended player and does not see the timeline for editing. A viewer can navigate between chapters and slides inside the player view, as well as search on its text.
  </p>

      The Course Playlist feature allows Media Gallery Managers to curate, organize and improve displayed featured content in their course’s Media Gallery. Course playlists were formerly referred to as collections.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Media Gallery managers can create a collection of media assets that can be presented throughout the application as a unified playlist.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The advantages of creating course playlists are that you can create ordered entries to determine what will be viewed and even repeat the same entry in a specific location (by adding the same entry to the Course Playlist). In addition, Course Playlists are organic elements that can be shared (embedded) as-is.
