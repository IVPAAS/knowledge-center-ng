Since traffic logs record communication from and to Kaltura, they can help identify the real cause behind issues that end users see in the front end.

Traffic logs are especially useful for Kaltura Support to investigate issues that are specific to the user’s network or that are not reproducible. For more information on how to capture traffic logs see [How to capture network traffic logs for Kaltura Support?][1]<a href="%20{{site.url}}/documentation/Knowledge/how-capture-network-traffic-logs-kaltura-support.html" target="_blank"></a>
