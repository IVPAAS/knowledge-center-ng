<span style="font-size: small;">Content Scheduling determines when your media entries will be permitted for viewing (“sunrise”) and when access should be automatically discontinued (“sunset”). You can set specific scheduling parameters for your content. You can set the entry to be available for display at any time (for example, no schedule limitations) or you can set the entry to be available during a limited timeframe (for example, display this video starting on X date with no end time, or display this video only between X date and Y date).  </span>

<span style="font-size: small;">Note that when users try to access a video that is no longer valid (in terms of its scheduling), they will receive an error message explaining that this content is no longer valid.</span>
