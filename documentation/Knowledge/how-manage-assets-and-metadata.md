### Metadata Actions

You can manage assets and metadata through the:

*   KMC UI - You can edit basic and custom metadata for a single asset, or apply a change of a few basic metadata fields to multiple selected assets.
*   KMC Bulk upload (CSV/XML) – You can add assets in batch, combining both media files and associated metadata. (See [Bulk Upload and FTP Upload][1]).
*   Kaltura APIs – All metadata-related functionality available through the KMC can also be performed using the Kaltura APIs. The APIs also expose additional functionality not available through the KMC. For more information see [here][2].
