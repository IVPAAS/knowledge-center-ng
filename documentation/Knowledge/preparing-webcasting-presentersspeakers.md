    Offer your webcast prersenters/speakers a timeline to establish expectations. It also helps to give them an idea of the time commitment they are signing on for to keep everyone on the same page and moving forward toward your live events – together. Here is an example of a presenter timeline you can share with your webcasting speakers:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      4 weeks prior to the webcast, speakers participate in a conference call with you to review content; go over questions; review expectations.
    </li>
    <li>
      3 weeks prior to the event, speakers should submit digital photo, contact information, biographical information, etc.
    </li>
    <li>
      2 weeks prior to the event, speakers submit video clips and presentation slides in a provided template.
    </li>
    <li>
      1 week prior to the webcast, speakers participate in a training/orientation call with the webcast producer.
    </li>
    <li>
      30 minutes prior to the webcast, speakers should have their computer, presentation and all other equipment tested, set up and ready to go.
    </li>
  </ul>

    Help Your Webcasting Speakers Plan
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    You want to support and prepare your webcasting speakers as much as possible to make sure your live event is successful and stress free! To make sure you don’t catch your webcasting speakers off guard with the amount of time it will take to present to your virtual audience, give them an outline of the time commitment you estimate it will take from them. Here is an example of what your webcasting speakers should expect:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      1 hour = Conference call with you and other speakers to review content
    </li>
    <li>
      2 to 4 hours = Prepare PowerPoint webcasting presentation slides
    </li>
    <li>
      1 hour = Webcasting training session/orientation call with you, co-presenters, and moderator
    </li>
    <li>
      X hours (actual webcasting length plus ½ hour, 20 minutes before and 10 minutes after)
    </li>
  </ul>
