<span>The number of views presented on the player and on the entry page has been changed to the number of plays.</span>

<ul class="mce-note-graphic">
  <li>
    <strong>views</strong> - entry was loaded
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>plays</strong> - viewer actually pressed the 'play' button or video actually started to play
  </li>
</ul>

<p class="mce-note-graphic">
  The number of plays should always be smaller than the number of views because users may load the entry page without actually playing the video.<br />In 'Autoplay' mode, the number of plays should be identical to the number of views.
