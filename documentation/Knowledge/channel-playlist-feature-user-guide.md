    Media Gallery managers can create a collection of media assets that can be presented throughout the application as a unified playlist.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The advantages of creating channel playlists are that you can create ordered entries to determine what will be viewed and even repeat the same entry in a specific location (by adding the same entry to the Channel Playlist). In addition, Channel Playlists are organic elements that can be shared (embedded) as-is.
