The Live Reports tab is enabled in the Analytics section for each KMC account that has **Kaltura Live** enabled

Live Reports display how many plays were counted for live entries. The Live Report's display is similar to all the other Kaltura analytics reports.

Plays (for all type of live entries) that are played through the Kaltura player (Kaltura, Akamai, Manual) are counted and displayed at a 1 hour granularity (for example, number of plays at 2pm, number of plays at 3pm, etc.), and are updated every 2-3 hours as all of Kaltura analytics are.

The total number of plays is displayed in the ‘Content > Entries’ tab, and is updated every 24 hours.

  Real time and historic view of full analytics suite - 3<sup>rd</sup> party Akamai Media Analytics
</p>

You may request to enable the Akamai Media Analytics (AMA) plugin on your player. The information that the AMA plugin facilitates is both real-time and contains a historical view of engagement data (for example, plays, visits, etc.) and QoS data (bitrate, buffering, etc.). This information is displayed in the Akamai’s Luna console.

The AMA setup may be configured through Kaltura Support. Contact your Account Manager to enable this feature.

To obtain analytics for a specific event, the AMA setup should be done prior to the event. There is no way to obtain the analytics data afterwards.
