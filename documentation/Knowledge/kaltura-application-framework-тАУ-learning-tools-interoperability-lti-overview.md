<h2>
    What is KAF
  </h2>
  
  <p>
    The Kaltura Application Framework (KAF) is an extensible, feature rich, UI based configurable framework that streamlines the integration of Kaltura’s rich media capabilities into different publishing applications. The framework is constructed of modules that provide a packaged workflow and functionalities that can be easily embedded in another application as an iFrame, instead of integrating directly with the Kaltura APIs. The framework can decrease the integration time with your application dramatically and allow you to always get up to date new functionality by decoupling the added features from the integration itself. The embedded iFrames are all based on a responsive design to ensure that the integrated pages are displayed properly on any given area.

  <h2>
    What is Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI)
  </h2>
  
  <p>
    The principal concept of LTI is to establish a standard way of integrating rich learning applications (often remotely hosted and provided through third-party services) with platforms like Learning Management Systems (LMSs), portals, or other educational environments. In LTI these learning applications are called Tools (delivered by Tool Providers) and the LMS, or platforms, are called Tool Consumers.

  <h2>
    KAF and LTI
  </h2>
  
  <p>
    To load a KAF module in an iFrame, an authentication process must occur so that the KAF module can identify the user and determine the user’s privileges. One of the available authentication methods is LTI.

  <h3>
    My Media
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    My Media is a repository of the user’s media, where each user has a personal searchable repository for viewing and managing media content. Media items within My Media may be added to course galleries and inline text based on user enrolment. Additionally, the content of My Media is shared and consistent across all Kaltura applications (e.g. MediaSpace) in use by the institution, thus My Media serves as the basis for the cross campus suite of media.
  </p>
  
  <h3>
    Media Gallery
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    The course Media Gallery is a searchable gallery of media content of a specific course. The Media Gallery does not necessarily include all media that is used within the course in other contexts. Instead, the Media Gallery contains the content that was deliberately assigned to it. The Media Gallery is intended to be used as a media syllabus for a course, as a social media repository of the course,  or in some cases for media assignments. The Media Gallery may be used simultaneously with media in context, as a standalone, or not at all, depending on how the teacher and school prefer to use it. The Media Gallery is implemented as a Course Tool and is available to course owners in the Course Tools menu.

  <h3>
    Rich Text Editor Integration
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    The rich-text editor integration allows users to add Kaltura content to different sections of the LMS where the rich-text editor is available such as assignment, discussions, etc.
