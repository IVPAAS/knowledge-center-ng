# Managing Content Entitlement

Kaltura provides a built-in infrastructure for controlling and managing end-user entitlements to content. This infrastructure includes the required attributes and permission controls as well as the server utilities for enforcing those controls.

Using Kaltura’s entitlement services, end-user facing applications such as Kaltura MediaSpace can be extended to add the following capabilities:

*   **Groups’ media channels - **Provides the ability to set media channels that limit access and contribution of content to members of a specific group of users.
*   **Granular control over user permissions to content - **Provides the ability to define different privacy and permission levels for accessing and managing content in media channels.
*   **Personalized global search engine - **Provides the ability for users to easily search and find relevant content from the entire set of media they are entitled to access.

### Kaltura’s Entitlement Model

Kaltura’s entitlement model relies on the extension of Kaltura’s categories.  Categories may hold entitlement settings as well as specific end-user permissions. These entitlement settings and end-user permissions are inherited by media entries associated with these types of categories. 

The entitlement model provides a direct association between end-users and the collection of media items they are entitled to access, and enables a simple and efficient way to add entitlement controls to both flat and hierarchal application/website navigation layout.
