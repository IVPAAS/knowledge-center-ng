If you want to configure your KMC account to support automated content ingestion workflows, you can optionally add default metadata settings from an existing entry. The default entry metadata setting automatically will populate the new content when using each specific transcoding profile.

For example, you want to target two distinct audiences with your videos, the first is public facing videos and the second is internal company videos.

You can create two transcoding profiles, one for each of your target audiences, even though you might convert them to the same flavors you can use different “default metadata settings” so your public facing videos will have their specific metadata values, while the internal company videos can have different fields or data. All this is done automatically after you prepare one template entry for the process.
