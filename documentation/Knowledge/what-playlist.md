A playlist is a list of media items (videos, audios, images) that can be embedded with a player in your website. Playlists can serve as the basis for RSS feeds, content feeds to over the top devices or integrations such as Roku, Boxee. See <a href="http://knowledge.kaltura.com/node/482/attachment/field_media#+Content+Syndication" target="_blank">Content Syndication</a>.

There are two types of playlists available in the KMC:

*   Manual
*   Rule Based

Manual playlists allow you to select a static list of items, while <a href="{{site.url}}/documentation/Knowledge/how-define-rule-playlist.html" target="_blank">Rule Based playlists</a> are dynamic, and automatically updated based on what's currently available in your media library and what rules define the playlist. After you've created your playlist, you can assign a playlist to a player. See <a href="http://knowledge.kaltura.com/node/1148#playlist_setup" target="_blank">How to setup a playlist</a>.

A simple manual playlist is limited to 500 entries; however, this may drop to 150 if the account makes use of entitlement.

A rule based playlist has a maximum of 200 entries, however, when the playlist is used in a syndication feed the limitation is 10,000 entries.
