<p>
    During the Webcast event you can view live analytics for your event. Live analytics can provide you with information on audience engagement and the quality of the broadcast. The producer application displays part of the live analytics available. Monitoring the live analytics during the event provides important information about your live event, such as:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      A drop in users can indicate that there are technical issues or that viewers are losing interest.
    </li>
    <li>
      Monitoring the average bitrate activity lets you understand the quality received on the viewers' side.
    </li>
  </ul>
