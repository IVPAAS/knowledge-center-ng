<span style="font-size: small;">You can track the upload processing in the Contents tab.</span>  
  
<span style="font-size: small;">The "Your Uploads" table lists all the in-progress and pending upload tasks. The list only shows media file uploads from the desktop that you performed during the current KMC session.</span>  
  
<span style="font-size: small;">For each uploaded file, you can view details such as:</span>  
  


*   <span style="font-size: small;">    File name</span>
*   <span style="font-size: small;">    File size</span>
*   <span style="font-size: small;">    ID of the Kaltura entry that this file is added to</span>

  
<span style="font-size: small;">You can use the table to:</span>  
  


*   <span style="font-size: small;">    Track the progress of each upload task.</span>
*   <span style="font-size: small;">    Reorder upload tasks that are waiting to be processed.</span>
*   <span style="font-size: small;">    Retry failed tasks.</span>

  
<span style="font-size: small;">Since file uploads are controlled by the KMC web application, closing or refreshing the browser page terminates all upload tasks that currently are in progress.</span>
