<h2>
    <span style="font-size: 1.5em;">Creating a Webcasting Event</span>
  </h2>
  
  <p>
    When you create a webcasting event, you will need to schedule the date and time for the event and design an entry page dedicated to the event.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The Webcast Event page serves as an initial information repository for the event and when the time comes, a landing page for streaming the event and archiving it. The Webcast Event page may be edited several times and be assigned different levels of privacy so that you can work on it in privacy and choose when to share or make the event public.
