<p class="MsoBodyText">
  You can define a rule-based playlist that consists of all the 0-4 minute video clips that were created in the past week. In addition to filtering, at the bottom of the window, you can define a prefered order for your playlist. You can order it by Most Viewed (overall, last week or last 24 hours) or Most Recent (for example, most recently added to the KMC). 
</p>

<p class="MsoBodyText">
  If you would like to create a dynamic playlist that at any given moment consists of the most viewed clips in the last week, all you need to do is create a new filter and select the "Most Viewed 7 Days" option from the "Order by" drop-down menu. 
</p>

<p class="MsoBodyText">
  On the bottom of the playlist you can see the number of entries in the playlist and their total length. You can automatically limit the number of entries that will be included in the playlist by adjusting the counter positioned to the right of the "Order by" drop-down menu. 
</p>

<p class="MsoBodyText">
  Your playlist can be based on a single rule or multiple rules. If you want to apply more than one rule to your playlist, click the "Switch to Advanced Mode" link at the bottom of the window. Note that this will clear all previous information that you have saved in your playlist.
