Media entries may be divided into categories. The different categories are built in a tree-like hierarchy where each category can include multiple sub-categories.

Categories provide a logical structure for your site and assist with content management. You can use categories, along with metadata and filters to create manually or dynamically generated playlists.  Categories may also be used for setting content entitlements to end-users in various applications.  See<a href="http://knowledge.kaltura.com/node/646" target="_blank"> Entitlement Settings.</a>

Categories are built in a tree-like hierarchy where each category can include multiple sub-categories. You can add, remove and edit categories from the Categories Tab. You can assign a media entry to a specific category from the Entries Tab.
