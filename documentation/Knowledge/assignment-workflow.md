<p style="text-align: justify;">
    KAF Administrators have the ability to prevent published content/media from being deleted or edited across the board for LMS integrations. For compliance reasons, assignments only may need to be blocked from editing or deletion.
  </p>
  
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
    A new configuration is available that allows users to indicate whether the content they are embedding is an assignment.
  </p>
  
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
    When a user indicates that they are submitting media as assignment, the entry is cloned under a  new user name ("original user name_assignment") .
  </p>
  
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
    The cloned entry will not be available in My Media to edit or delete. This ensures that assignments are saved and cannot be edited or deleted.
