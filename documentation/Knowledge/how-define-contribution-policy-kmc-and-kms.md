### Contribution Policy

The contribution policy option defines which end-users can add content to this category through applications. The applicative permission to publish in MediaSpace’s shared Galleries is set from the MediaSpace Application Role of the user. See the [Kaltura MediaSpace Setup Guide][1] for more information. The category contribution policy adds the ability to have this type of authorization for publishing content in specific galleries/channels.

The Category Contribution Policy options are:

*   **No Restriction – **With this option, any end-user authorized to publish content in MediaSpace can publish content in the gallery/channel associated with this category. In MediaSpace this option is used in shared galleries to which every user with a MediaSpace Admin Application Role can add content to, and in Open Channels to which all MediaSpace users with content can add their content to. 
*   **Private - **With this option, only end-users with specific permission to add content to this category are able to add content to it. In MediaSpace this option is used in Restricted/Private Channels.
