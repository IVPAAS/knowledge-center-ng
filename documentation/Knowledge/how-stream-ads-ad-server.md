<span style="font-size: small;">Kaltura partners have the ability to create a custom .swf file to stream ads from their own ad server to the Kaltura Player. The .swf file acts as an ad plugin. The configured key-value pairs must be defined to play the relevant ads.</span>

<span style="font-size: small;">You have to subscribe to an ad server and configure the ads on the ad server side.</span>
