You can cancel a transcoding or distribution job that is in progress only before a batch worker starts the job.

After a batch worker starts a transcoding or distribution job, the job runs to completion.

For more information on canceling jobs, see [Kaltura Admin Console Quick Start Guide][1], Batch Process Control Tab.
