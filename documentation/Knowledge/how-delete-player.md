<span style="font-size: small;">Deleting a player eliminates it from all the locations where the player has been previously embedded. For example, if you have embedded a player using this design on your site or an external site, after you delete it from the Player List, the player will no longer appear and a blank area will be displayed on the website.<br /><br /></span>
