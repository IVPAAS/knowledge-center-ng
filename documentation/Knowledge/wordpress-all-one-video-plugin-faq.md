*   **Where are the videos stored?**   
    The videos are stored on the Kaltura's servers. You are welcome to check out our [community edition][1] that lets you host all the content on your servers.
*   **How do I make sure I unpacked the plugin correctly?**   
    Make sure you follow the instructions specified in the readme file, and that you see the followng directories:  
    <pre>wp-content/plugins/all-in-one-video-pack/admin
wp-content/plugins/all-in-one-video-pack/images</pre>and all other related directories.

*   **I can't complete the registration process. What am I doing wrong?**   
    Make sure you have your blog's name set through WordPress. It is a read only field in the plugin's settings page, if the blog's name is not set through WordPress, the registration process cannot be completed.
*   **Can I create <a name="multiple_blogs"></a>multiple blogs with one account (partner ID)?**   
    Yes – but then they are interdependent. When a video is edited in one blog, the edits will propogate to all the others.
*   **Does the plugin work with WorsPress MU?**   
    Yes – We recommend that each user should open a different account, unless they want the blog to be dependent on other blogs as specified in the FAQ about[ multiple blogs][2].
*   **Do you offer customization options for the WordPress plugin?**   
    To get attractive customization options for licensing agreements as well as functionalities and skinning, please contact our [sales department][3].
