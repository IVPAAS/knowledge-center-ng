The Flash Live Streaming service uses the usual RTMP protocol while the HD Flash Live Streaming service generally uses HDS. There are different sets of tested/qualified encoder for these services.

For Flash Live Stream, the following encoders were tested, however there should be no problem using other encoders:

*   Adobe Flash Media Live Encoder (FMLE) v3.0
*   Adobe Flash Media Encoder (FME) - v1.0, v2.0, v2.5
*   On2 Flix Live
*   Inlet Spinnaker
*   Digital Rapids StreamZ
*   Viewcast Niagara 2120
*   Orban Opticodec

For HD Flash Live Stream, the qualified encoders that we recommend our customers to use are listed in the following table. Â There are known issues where certain features may not work well with encoders not in the list.<img src="../../assets/967.img">
