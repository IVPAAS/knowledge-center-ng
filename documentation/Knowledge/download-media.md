<span>In addition, the admin will have to configure the flavors that will be visible for the media owner to choose from. The admin can choose as many flavors as he or she wants from the list of the transcoding profiles, as they apear in the KMC. He or she then can name them as they will appear to the media owner (if no name will be given, the flavor default name in Kaltura will be given by default). Note that the final list which will apear for the media owner will be from what was chosen by the admin from the list and what is actually set (in the KMC) for this KMS instance and available flavors on the specific entry. It is advised that the KMS admin will verify with KMC admin what is checked for the account beforehand.</span>
