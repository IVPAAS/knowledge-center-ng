In the Kaltura Management Console (KMC), you use the Features tab in the Edit Player or Create New Player window to select a player's features.

The Features tab is made up of different sections, controlling the various features of the player.

Use the options in this tab to select the features (buttons, layers and modules) to be included in your player.

The main screen is divided into the Features List on the left and the Preview pane on the right. As you select your features from the list, you can preview the changes in real time in the preview pane on the right.
