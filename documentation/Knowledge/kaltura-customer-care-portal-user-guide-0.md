    <h2>
      Priority Setting
    </h2>
    
    <p>
      One of the main advantages of the Kaltura Customer Portal over other communication methods with Kaltura Customer Care, is the ability to convey the priority and sense of urgency of your case.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      After a case is opened, its priority is taken into consideration and your case is handled accordingly. Please note that in addition to priority, other parameters such as the issue’s scope, scale and severity also affect the triage process. Priority levels include the following:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Essential priority</strong> - The problem causes a major production flow to shut down, and the operator is prevented from performing a major part of work needed using the Kaltura platform. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">No workaround exists</span>, and the customer must receive immediate resolution for this problem.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>High</strong> <strong>priority</strong> - The problem causes a major production flow to shut down, and the operator cannot perform a major part of the work needed using the Kaltura platform.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Medium</strong> <strong>priority</strong> - The problem causes partial unavailability of a service, its features, and functions. The customer can continue to function without this service.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Low priority</strong> – The issue reported by the customer has a low impact on business flow. Low priority items include general questions, requests for enhancement, cosmetic UI bugs, etc.
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>
      Case Status
    </h2>
    
    <p>
      Use the ‘Create Case’ button to open your case with Kaltura Customer Care. You can follow the current status of investigation by reviewing the case status, as defined by one of the following:
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <strong>Open Statuses</strong>
    </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>
        New - your case was accepted and is pending investigation.
      </li>
      <li>
        In Progress - the case is currently under investigation by Kaltura support engineers or experts.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pending Your Response - Customer Care replied to the case and requested further information from you.
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
      If you would like additional updates, please feel free to reach out to Kaltura Customer Care by replying to the case.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      After a case is closed, it receives one of the following statuses:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>
        Closed – Resolved - You are satisfied with the solution offered to the case and no longer require Customer Care’s assistance. With your confirmation, the case is marked as permanently closed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Closed - Solution Provided to Customer - Customer Care provided a solution to your case.
      </li>
      <li>
        Closed - Duplicate case – The case duplicates an existing case.
      </li>
      <li>
        Closed - No Response from Customer – Case was pending a response from the customer for over 14 days
      </li>
      <li>
        Closed - Account matters – The case should be handled by

      <li>
        Closed – Closed due to other reasons (project matters, eligibility for support, product limitation, etc.)
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>
      Account Hierarchies
    </h2>
    
    <p>
      Depending on your organization’s structure, your account can be one of the following types:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>
        Parent account – contains sub-accounts. Sub-accounts often characterize inner relationships of corporations and their departments, universities consortiums and their academic departments, etc.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sub-account – has a parent account (The parent account may have more parallel sub-accounts.)
