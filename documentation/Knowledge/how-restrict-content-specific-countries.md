Geographic restrictions, similar to domain restrictions, allow you to define a “white list” or a “black list” of specific geographical locations, limiting or enabling playback attempts of content for users located in these locations. For example, a Kaltura Player entry assigned with geo-restrictions where the white list contains only Spain can be placed on any domain but will only be playable by viewers located in Spain.
