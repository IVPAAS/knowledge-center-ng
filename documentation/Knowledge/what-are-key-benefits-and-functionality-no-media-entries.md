You can prepare a new media entry in the KMC and set its metadata and publishing information beforehand, or in parallel, to the actual media processing and then add the media files to the existing entry when ready. 

This flexibility may be of value especially with large media operational teams, when the metadata preparation effort is separated from the media preparation effort with different teams working on each operation.  Separating these tasks, may provide more efficiency to the company’s internal processes as editing metadata can be done without dependency on the media preparation operation.

When you prepare a No Media entry in the KMC you can upload the media file/s to Kaltura at a later time either by uploading the source for transcoding in Kaltura or uploading media assets/files that have already been generated locally using your own transcoder.

Note that the option to use a local transcoder to ingest flavors is a feature that is not enabled by default . Contact your Kaltura account manager to learn more about how this feature can simplify your workflow, and to activate and configure this feature on your account.
