    Creating and Working with Interactive Video Quizzes
  </h1>
  
  <p>
    This guide describes how to use Kaltura’s Interactive Video Quizzes (IVQ) feature in Kaltura’s systems. Interactive Video Quizzes (IVQ) integrates and works seamlessly with Kaltura MediaSpace (KMS) and all Kaltura Application Framework (KAF) based applications, such as different Learning Management Systems (LMSs) and Social Business Software (SBSs). The IVQ feature is based on the Kaltura Player version 2.0.

  <h3>
    Adding Interactivity to Media
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    Adding Interactive Video Quizzes (IVQ) to media increases the power of educational and training videos by embedding questions directly into the video. Kaltura’s interactive IVQ adds an effective way of imparting information by allowing the viewer to engage directly with the video. The quiz creator can also monitor the video’s impact. The IVQ feature increases engagement, enables effectivity measurement, and provides a new way to improve learning outcomes.

  </p>
  
  <h3>
    Features and Options
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    IVQ provides an easy-to-use quiz creation wizard that enables you to create an unlimited number of multiple choice questions with 2-4 optional answers per question. The wizard allows configuration of supportive learning tools that can include options that allow the user to download the questions before taking the quiz, request hints regarding quiz question answers, receive explanations regarding correct or incorrect answers, skip questions and return later to answer them.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Users can watch media segments multiple times in preparation for answering questions; and receive feedback, correct answers, and in-depth explanations when completing questions.
  </p>
  
  <p>

  <p>
    
  </p>
  
  <h3>
    How Do Interactive Video Quizzes Work?
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    Through its easy-to-use interface, the quiz creator can seamlessly embed multiple choice questions at any point in a video. As users watch the video, each question appears at its chosen point; the video continues after the user answers the question. Flexible settings allow quiz creators to choose whether to allow users to repeat sections, skip questions, revise answers, receive hints, and discover the correct answers. Practically, IVQ increases engagement, tests knowledge and retention, and gathers media effectiveness data.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    On the quiz creator’s side, IVQ integrates seamlessly as part of Kaltura’s standalone applications like MediaSpace or Kaltura integrated applications on windows and Mac platforms. It can be used with the customer’s LMS or SBS such as Blackboard, Canvas, Moodle, BrightSpace, Sakai, SharePoint 2013, Jive, and IBM Connections.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    On the playback side, IVQ is part of Kaltura player and is supported by the player wherever media quizzes are embedded and presented. Viewing and use is supported on any digital device.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The following list provides a few examples of IVQ use cases:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      IVQ enables the quiz creator to add questions or polls to lectures, training videos, marketing materials, and other media. This enables the creator to increase audience engagement with the media content, and reduce user drop-out rates.
    </li>
    <li>
      IVQ enables the quiz creator to link learning materials directly to test questions so that users received immediate feedback about whether or not they understood the information presented.
    </li>
    <li>
      The IVQ customer can create a lightweight certification system that provides an easy way to present both course material and testing.
    </li>
    <li>
      IVQ enables Kaltura customers to conduct market research, and collect feedback or poll results inside the media used to present information or choices.
    </li>
  </ul>

If you will be taking the quiz from a different page (not from ‘Preview’ page)  for example, from the entry page, you can only take the quiz once.<br />IVQ also supports anonymous users. If your environment supports unauthenticated (i.e., anonymous) users, you can also preview the quiz from an entry page as an anonymous user, over and over again. These multiple views will be accounted for in the quiz analytics.

  <p>
    
  </p>
  
  <p>
     
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The following points cover the best practices, as recommended by Kaltura for quiz creators:
  </p>
  
  <ol>
    <li>
      Be sure to shuffle your answers.
    </li>
    <li>
      All incorrect answer options should be plausible.
    </li>
    <li>
      It is not recommended to use "all of the above" and "none of the above" as wrong-answer options.
    </li>
    <li>
      Make sure the question is meaningful by itself and represents a definite problem.
    </li>
    <li>
      Keep answer lengths similar.
    </li>
    <li>
      Try not to create trick questions, but rather allow for constructive learning.
    </li>
    <li>
      Use only 1 correct answer and make sure that it is clear why the others are not the correct options.
    </li>
    <li>
      It is recommended to put the last question at the end of the video to keep the user engaged through the entire subject.
    </li>
