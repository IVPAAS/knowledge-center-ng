  <span style="font-size: small;">This FAQ applies to the legacy KDP Flash player. To configure ads using the Universal player please see <a href="http://knowledge.kaltura.com/universal-studio-information-guide#monetization" target="_blank">here</a></span>
</p>

<span style="font-size: small;">Bumpers are videos that act as ads and do not use an ad server. Bumper videos uploaded to Kaltura can be inserted before or after a video, to function as pre-rolls or post-rolls. <span>B</span><span>umper videos are associated with a player, and not associated with a specific video. </span>Bumper videos are independent of actual pre/post-rolls and can be played in addition to ads. Bumper videos are helpful for Kaltura partners that would like to advertise their logo, or other information, before or after a video, and for smaller partners that would like to advertise, but do not expect to monetize from their ads.</span>

<span style="font-size: small;">Bumper videos can be configured in addition to any other ads that are configured. On the bottom of the Advertising section, the option to add bumper videos only is available.</span>
