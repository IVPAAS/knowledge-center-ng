    <a name="video_clip"></a>Creating a Video Clip
  </h2>
  
  <p>
    When clipping is enabled on the account and for the specific media, you can create clips from existing videos. Each clip becomes its own media entry. The clipping tool enables you to edit your videos visually or by setting the start time and end time of your clip.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Clipping creates a new entry from an existing entry and allows you to specify the start and end time for the new entry. For example you can clip an entry that can be used to create a 2 minute intro video to a long lecture, or clip part of an entry, such as homework assignments. You can also clip a long lecture to several shorter clips divided by subjects.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Entries can be clipped by the media entry owner in My Media and by other users in a course Media Gallery, according to the media and course settings.

    You can trim out parts of video from the Edit Media page. The trimming tool enables you to edit your videos visually by setting the start time and end time of your media.
