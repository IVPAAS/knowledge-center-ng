You can define and set a remote storage and delivery profile for a specific publisher account by checking the Remote Storage option in the Publisher Management Page- Enable Disable Features section.  The remote storage and delivery solution can be used to enable storage and delivery of video assets from a network storage location that is external to the Kaltura Platform.  This feature is commonly used to leverage a publisher’s CDN network storage solution (for example, <a href="http://www.akamai.com/html/technology/products/netstorage.html" target="_blank">Akamai’s NetStorage</a>). Selecting this option will lead you to the Remote Storage Profiles page for creating or editing publisher specific Remote Storage profiles. Access to the remove storage profiles is also possible through the Publisher Management Page- Enable Disable Features Remote Storage feature “config” link.
