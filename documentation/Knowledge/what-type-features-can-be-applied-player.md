In the Kaltura Management Console (KMC), you use the Features tab in the Edit Player or Create New Player window to select a player's features.

The Features tab contains the list of configurable features (buttons, layers and modules) available for the selected player. Checking the box next to any feature allows you to preview it in the Preview Pane. Most of the features have in-depth configuration options.
