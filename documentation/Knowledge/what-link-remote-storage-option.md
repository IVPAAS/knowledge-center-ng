<span style="font-size: small;">Kaltura’s Remote Storage and Delivery solution enables publishers to manage their video assets and account settings on Kaltura’s hosted video platform while actually storing the content on their own remote network storage location, and delivering the content from the same remote location. Kaltura’s remote storage and delivery capabilities are fully integrated with the platform’s ingestion, transcoding and publishing workflows, and provide system flexibility for addressing publishers’ specific storage and delivery needs.</span>  
  
<span style="font-size: small;">You can link content to remote storage from the KMC User Interface. The Link to Remote Storage option is useful for partners that use their own transcoder and also host and deliver content on/from a remote storage (e.g. CDN storage, internal organization storage). The partner’s transcoder generates the flavors. After the files are uploaded directly to the remote storage it is only necessary to indicate which flavors to link to an entry in Kaltura. The connection of the remote storage profile to the transcoding profile is used for this purpose. </span>
