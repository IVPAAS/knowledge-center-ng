The following additional settings are available at the lower part of the Entitlements tab:

*   Category Owner – a category attribute, for setting one of the channel managers as the channel owner for any applicative need. The category owner is automatically set with a manager permission level for the category. See [Change Owner][1].
*   Default Permission Level – a category attribute for setting a specific default permission level to the category, for supporting different applicative flows.
*   Moderate Content - a category attribute, for supporting the moderation of content prior it’s publishing in the channel. (Moderation is configured through MediaSpace.)
