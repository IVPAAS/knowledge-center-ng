  For the End-User
</p>

The ability to grab embed codes has been added to to the View Media page in all KAF based applications. The Embed option is available under the 'Share' tab. When enabled, those that have access to view the media are also able to grab the embed code.

<p class="mce-note-graphic">
  Note for Kaltura MediaSpace users: The Link to Media Page and oEmbed options are not available in KAF based applications as they are in MediaSpace.

  For the Administrator
</p>

*   A MediaSpace admin can enable the grab embed functionality in the *KAF Admin Console > Embed *module*.*
*   It is possible to configure secure embed and limit the grab embed to a specific user or to specific application roles.

In the past, the Embed configuraiton page was used to control the behavior of the *Browse, Search and Embed* module (used for embeding Kaltura Media entries in rich text editors in KAF applications). Also, a bug in KAF caused the *Embed* configuraiton page to always appear as disabled. This has now changed:

*   All *Browse, Search and Embed* configuration options are now available under the *Browseandembed* configuration page in the Hosted section in KAF. The *Browseandembed* module can be enabled or disabled, but the recommendation is to always keep it enabled.
*   The *Embed* configuration page now only controls the grab embed functionality as described and can be enabled or disabled per the administrator's discretion.
