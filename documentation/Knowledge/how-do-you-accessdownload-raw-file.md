If you have the entry ID of the raw file on hand, go to  - <a href="http://cdnakmi.kaltura.com/p/PARTNER_ID_HERE/raw/entry_id/ENTRY_ID_HERE/file_name/name" target="_blank">http://cdnakmi.kaltura.com/p/PARTNER_ID_HERE/raw/entry_id/ENTRY_ID_HERE/file_name/name</a>. You will be prompted to download the file with the original file name.
