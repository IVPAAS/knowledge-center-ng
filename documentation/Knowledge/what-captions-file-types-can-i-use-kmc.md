</p>

<span>A <strong>caption file</strong> contains <em>both the text and information</em> about when each line of text should be displayed. </span>

<span>A caption is synonymous with <strong>subtitle</strong> and is usually displayed at the bottom of the screen.</span>

<span>SRT and DXFP are text file formats that contain captions; <strong>including the time</strong> each subtitle should be displayed followed by the text of the subtitle. </span>

<span>If the caption includes non-dialog text, the file is considered a <strong>closed caption</strong>. </span>

**<span>Transcriptions</span>** are files that contain text of the video without time stamps. <span class="BodyTextChar">If the video is in English, use our partner 3PlayMedia to apply speech processing algorithms to determine when the words in a transcript should be displayed.</span> (<a href="http://www.3playmedia.com/how-it-works/webinars/video-accessibility-best-practices-teaching-learning/" target="_blank">See 3Play Media's interactive transcript player in action</a>). 

<span>Captions can either be a form of written translation of a dialog in a foreign language or a written rendering of the dialog in the same language. Closed captions files contain added information to help viewers who are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deaf" title="Deaf"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; color: #666560;">deaf</span></a> and <span style="color: #666560;">hard-of-hearing</span> to follow the dialog, or people who cannot understand the spoken dialogue or who have accent recognition problems. </span>
