The MediaSpace user-flows for determining user’s entitlements to content and categories are best supported when permissions are set to individuals and indexed in Kaltura. The internal indexing of content by its individual end-user permissions enables the best real-time performance for content retrievals regardless of the organization size, the content volume, and the number of groups within the organization each user may be a member of.

Kaltura provides the tools, APIs and guidelines for setting automatic and on-going synchronization between group membership information managed in the organizational systems and the individual permissions set to categories in Kaltura.
