<p>
    Slides are an integral part of a Kaltura Webcasting event, and provide attendees with the option of seeing the slides along with the speaker without live mixing capabilities. The slides are also available in the VOD for metadata and search purposes.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    After you create and set up the Kaltura Webcast Event and have exported or manually migrated the stream ID and primary and backup URLS to your live encoder you are ready to start streaming.

  </h3>
  
  <p>
    The current slide will be broadcasted only after you apply the uploaded slide deck to the Timeline area at the bottom of the Webcasting Application. The slides are broadcasted alongside the video. At any point during the event, the producer, moderator and presenter can advance or backtrack to a specific slide in the presentation.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    As part of the processing for slides, each slide is turned into an image file. All text in the slide is extracted to enable search and discoverability of slides both during the live event and when viewing the VOD.

    <a name="extendingscreen"></a>Extending Your Presentation to Another Display Screen
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    The Kaltura Webcasting software enables you to extend your presentation to another display screen using the <strong>projector</strong> icon. Clicking the projector icon enables you to show the live event on an extended screen to a local audience.
  </p>
  
  <h3>
    <a name="browsing"></a>Browsing Slides in the Presentation Timeline
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    You can browse through the slide deck on the timeline area during a live broadcast, preview other slides, and skip directly to present a designated slide.
  </p>
  
  <ul style="padding-left: 30px;">
    <li>
      Press the arrow buttons on the sides of the slide deck timeline, or use [Alt + right arrow] or [Alt + right arrow] keyboard shortcut. <br />Clicking and holding the arrow, will accelerate the slide browsing speed.
    </li>
    <li>
      When you are browsing, changing slides on the slide presentation will not affect the slides viewed in the timeline. Click the <strong>Sync Timeline and Presentation</strong> icon [Alt + up arrow] on the lower left of the timeline (or [Ctrl + G] keyboard shortcut) to show the next slide in the center of the timeline and sync the timeline and presentation.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p class="mce-note-graphic" style="padding-left: 90px;">
    Note: The slide that appears in the middle of the screen is the <strong>next</strong> slide, not the current slide, while the timeline shows a preview of the entire slide deck. 
  </p>
  
  <p class="mce-note-graphic" style="padding-left: 90px;">
    Note: You can also use an external clicker to switch slides, as long as you map the clicker to the same keyboard shortcuts as defined in the application.
