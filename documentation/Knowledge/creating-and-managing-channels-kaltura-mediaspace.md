4.  Click Save.

You can access the new channel from your My Channels page.

Be certain to take a moment to consider your privacy settings. You have the option of deciding who sees what, and you should make a conscious choice here. You can decide to allow only members to send messages or share videos with you; to let others see your “channel” on MediaSpace if they have your e-mail address; and to share or hide “interesting statistics” about each of your videos with your viewers.
