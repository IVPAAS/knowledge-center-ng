This use case is typically combined with transcoding performed on the publisher’s side, after which the output files are pushed directly to CDN hosting, or to a local intranet delivery source.   
In this case, Kaltura essentially only manages the metadata while media files themselves are delivered directly from the publisher through a CDN to the viewer.  
Linking between the files and a Kaltura entry can be done through the KMC, API, or drop folder xml ingestion.<span style="font-size: small;">  </span>See <a href="http://knowledge.kaltura.com/node/46" target="_blank">Kaltura Drop Folders Service For Content Ingestion</a>.
