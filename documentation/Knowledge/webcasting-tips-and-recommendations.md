<p>
    Before you start your live broadcast, make sure you take the following into consideration:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      Start the broadcast earlier 
    </li>
    <li>
      Check that everything is working as expected: sound, equipment etc...
    </li>
    <li>
      Make sure you have the correct and final presentation - last minute changes are common.
    </li>
    <li>
      Pro tip: Recommend presenters to wear plain clothing - patterned clothes such as plaid or stripes often don't appear well in video.
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    During the broadcast:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      Moderate the Q&A activity by routing questions to the appropriate people and delivering the responses quickly.<br />Note: the  Q&A can be saved and viewed after the broadcast.
    </li>
    <li>
      Remember to post polls during the presentation to engage your audience.
    </li>
    <li>
      Monitor the Live Analytics:<ul>
        <li>
          A drop in users can indicate that there are technical issues or that viewers are losing interest.
        </li>
        <li>
          Monitoring the average bitrate activity lets you understand the quality received on the viewers' side.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    After the broadcast has ended:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <span class="inline-comment-marker" data-ref="07899cf0-67ef-4eb7-a8ff-7ee4988c1382">Download the Live Analytics from the KMC.</span>
    </li>
    <li>
      Export the Q&A session. The Q&A is exported as a CSV file that can be opened in MS Excel and its equivalents. 
    </li>
    <li>
      Use the clipping and trimming tools to edit out unnecessary parts. 
    </li>
  </ul>
