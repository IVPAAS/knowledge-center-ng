Publishers can replace media files of an existing media entry when needed.

This feature:

*   Is especially useful when media assets need to be re-edited by the publishers following ingestion to Kaltura.
*   Enables seamless replacement of media even if media is already published/ syndicated/distributed – media is replaced in all published instances.
*   Replaces all multiple-bitrate media assets flavors in one transaction.
*   Allows review and approval of new media prior to the actual replacement.
*   Is an integral part of the entry life-cycle and content management workflow.
