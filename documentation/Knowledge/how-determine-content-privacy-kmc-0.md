### Content Privacy

The content privacy defines the visibility of content associated with a category, including its related metadata.  The Content Privacy setting is applied to:

*   Who has access to content published in channel pages
*   Which content will be available to the user in the application global search results
*   Who can access to a single media item in the application.

The Content Privacy options are:

*   **No Restriction** – Content in the category is visible to everyone with access to the application page it is published in.   **In MediaSpace** - this option is mostly relevant for setting Media Galleries that are open on the web and can be accessible by everyone, including anonymous viewers. 
*   **Requires Authentication** – Content in the category is visible only to authenticated end-users – **In MediaSpace** this option is mostly relevant for setting Media Galleries or Open/Restricted Media Channels that are available to all authenticated users (users of the company/Institution, customers with login etc.) User authentication is made by MediaSpace against the customer Identity Management system, or with using Kaltura’s authentication services. In both cases, the authenticated user ID is then passed to the Kaltura server through the application session.
*   **Private** – Content in this category is visible only to users with specific permission to access this category's content and to the owner of the content.  **In MediaSpace** this option is mostly relevant for setting Private Media Channels - available only to a group of users.
*   Note: With any content privacy option the owner of the content is entitled to access and manage his content
