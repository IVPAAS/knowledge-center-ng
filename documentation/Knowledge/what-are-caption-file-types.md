<span style="font-size: small;">You can upload multiple subtitle and caption files (SRT, DXFP, XML) and transcripts (TXT), or reference an external link to a captions file in the KMC. Viewers can then select and toggle between different language subtitles and captions. Subtitles and captions are fully searchable as a metadata field.Â  </span>
