<p>
    After a Webcasting event is completed, a VOD of the event is saved and can be provided to viewers.

    To access the link of the VOD file
  </p>
  
  <ol>
    <li>
      In the Edit event page, click Invite Attendees.<br /><img src="{{site.url}}/assets/2904">
    </li>
    <li>
      Open the ics file.<br />The link created at the bottom of the message is the link to the Event Page. The link provided is also where the live broadcast will take place and reside as a VOD after the event.<br /><img src="{{site.url}}/assets/2906">
    </li>
    <li>
      Add the recipients as you would normally do with your mail client and send the message to the event attendees.
    </li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>
    After the live event finishes, the VOD is accessible to viewers through the same URL (you don't need to upload the file to a different location so there is no delay with the recording). Viewers simply click the same link you provided to go directly to the VOD file. This enables viewers who were unable to attend the live event to access the file without requesting a link.
