<span style="font-size: small;">You can add your media and metadata to a drop folder (On-Pre or on the Kaltura servers) and the Kaltura system will activate an ingestion workflow tailored to your needs.</span>  
<span style="font-size: small;">You can also upload metadata only and deliver media directly from your CDN, or on-premise storage. </span>
