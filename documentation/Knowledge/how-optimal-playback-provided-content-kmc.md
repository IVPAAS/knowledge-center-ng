<span style="font-size: small;">Kaltura’s player provides optimal playback by using adaptive bitrate technology that automatically selects the most appropriate file for playback, based on the viewer’s specific connection and other parameters.</span>  
  
<span style="font-size: small;">Getting content onto the platform is the first step and selecting transcoding information is part of the upload session. For a quick and simple upload, use the default flavors that are provided and that can be enabled/disabled from the transcoding profile you want to use. </span>
