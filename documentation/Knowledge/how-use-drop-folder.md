The Kaltura Drop Folder is a paid for service that enables you to automate the ingestion of content into the Kaltura platform. The Drop Folder service constantly watches each drop folder for new content, and activates automatic ingestion of new content to the specific account.  
  
Kaltura offers multiple configuration options for setting each drop folder to a specific workflow.  Contact your Kaltura account manager to learn more about how drop folders can simplify your workflow, and to activate and configure drop folders on your account.
