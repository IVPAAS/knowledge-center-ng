<p>
    A great way to engage your audience is through <strong>Q&A</strong>. Moderated Q&A is done live and provides attendees with the opportunity to ask questions and receive responses during the live broadcast. The Q&A moderator can manage and respond to the incoming questions from the attendees. Only the viewer that asked the question can see the response to that question. All moderators can see all questions from the audience. Moderators and presenters can also choose to make a question public and viewable by all attendees by answering the questions on-air.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    A key tip for managing chat is to have a dedicated webcast moderator or a group of moderators. You can use the follow-up queue to defer questions to the presenter or a subject matter expert. At the end of the event, you can export a transcript of the Q&A and share with all presenters. 
  </p>
  
  <p class="mce-note-graphic">
    Note: Q&A are in addition to the comments that can be added to the Event page below the presentation and do not share the same content. We recommend using the moderated Q&A module during the event and turning off comments on the event page. After the event, you can enable comments on the event page.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You can control what questions are answered and viewed by selecting a question from the list and clicking <strong>Announce. </strong>You can also enable or disable chats for the live event.

    Note: <span>Webcasting allows users to connect as anonymous users and submit Q&A questions / cue points without identifying themselves during the webcast.</span>

    The Q&A menu consists of the following functionality:

    To ensure that you are able to interact with the attendees, you will need to verify that the Q&A module is enabled in the MediaSpace or KAF Admin Console. You can enable or disable the Q&A module for all webcasting events created in your MediaSpace or KAF based application. If you decide to enable Q&A for your environment, each event owner can later decide whether to enable or disable Q&A per event.
