The Kaltura CMS and LMS modules are already integrated with the host CMS/LMS entitlement infrastructure. Access to content managed in Kaltura via the CMS/LMS is, and was always, managed through the CMS/LMS permission/enrolment settings. It is possible to share content between categories integrated by a CMS/LMS module and those integrated by MediaSpace with **no need to add entitlement settings to the categories integrated with the CMS/LMS module.** Utilization of Kalturaâ€™s entitlement infrastructure by any CMS/LMS extension is possible but requires application adjustments for using the entitlement infrastructure and services.
