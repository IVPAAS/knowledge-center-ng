The Update Channel Thumbnail feature allows the KMS Channel Manager to choose and set a thumbnail for a channel. Previously, the channel thumbnail was set by default based on the type and content of the channel. The thumbnail was based on the last media item published to the channel. If there was no media, the thumbnail was based on the type of channel (open, private, moderated, shared repository).

<p class="mce-note-graphic">
  The thumbnail permissions are available in MANAGER view only.
</p>

When a channel manager creates a new channel, the channel's thumbnail cannot be chosen and the default thumbnail is used. The channel manager can change the thumbnail only after the channel is created.

A Channel Manager can set an entry thumbnail to be the channel thumbnail.
