<p>
    Kaltura can host your transcoded files. You can simply upload each transcoded rendition (either via the UI or the API) and then play it back in the Kaltura Player.

    A sample of extending the player to support special experiences, such as spherical video can be found <a href="http://patrickms.github.io/KalturaHackathon2014/" target="_blank">here</a>.
