You can replace media content when an entry is ready for publishing or when a media processing error occurred. The entry itself, with its current metadata, entry ID, and analytics information, remains unchanged.

All Transcoding Flavors are replaced as one unit to ensure that inconsistency errors do not occur between old and new Transcoding Flavors at any given time.

You can review the Transcoding Flavors of the new media file in a temporary entry that is available for this purpose only. After you approve media replacement, all of the entry’s existing Transcoding Flavors are deleted and will be replaced by the new ones.
