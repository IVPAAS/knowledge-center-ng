You can prepare a video entry without including the media content in advance.  Creating a No Media entry may be useful when metadata settings and media perpetrations are managed separately and possibly by different operational teams This scenario is used for media that may be included at a later stage, for example, in a drop folder.  See [Using a Drop Folder][8].
