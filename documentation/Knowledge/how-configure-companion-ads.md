Companion Ads are text, display ads, rich media, or skins that wrap around the video experience, and can run alongside either or both the video or ad content. The primary purpose of the Companion Ad product is to offer sustained visibility of the sponsor throughout the video content experience.” See <http://www.iab.net/wiki/index.php/Companion_Ad>
