  <h3>
    Restart your home network
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    Here’s how to restart your home network:
  </p>
  
  <ol>
    <li>
      Turn off your computer
    </li>
    <li>
      Unplug your modem and your wireless router if it’s a separate device
    </li>
    <li>
      Wait for about one minute
    </li>
    <li>
      Plug in your modem and wait until no new indicator lights are blinking. If you unplugged your router, plug it back in and wait until no new indicator lights are blinking.
    </li>
    <li>
      Turn on your computer and try playing your video
    </li>
  </ol>
  
  <h3>
    Connect your computer to your modem
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    Try plugging your computer directly into your modem or router with an ethernet cable, rather than connecting wirelessly. If this fixes the problem, reposition your modem or router, as interference or range issues may have caused the poor connectivity.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you are connected directly to your modem and still cannot play your video, you may want to check with your equipment provider to make sure your modem and Internet service are working properly.
  </p>
  
  <h3>
    Check your Internet connectivity
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    If the above steps didn't help, try these tips to improve your Internet connectivity:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      Make sure your Internet usage isn’t at capacity – for example, someone on your home network is downloading a large file while you’re trying to watch YouTube.
    </li>
    <li>
      Check your computer for viruses, spyware or a hard drive that’s reached its full capacity.
    </li>
    <li>
      Move your router to a new location to improve signal strength. Your router should be elevated off the floor (like on a bookshelf or desk), and placed in a central location in your home.
    </li>
    <li>
      Move any cordless phones, microwave ovens, or other wireless devices away from your router. These devices often cause wireless interference.
    </li>
  </ul>
