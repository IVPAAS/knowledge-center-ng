## Category’s Entitlements Tab

Entitlement settings may be set on categories in different ways, for example, from the application, via the CSV or through a Kaltura API. The Category’s Entitlements tab in the KMC is where content entitlement settings are managed by account administrators. The Entitlements tab only appears in KMC accounts that are set with the entitlement feature and in categories that were set to have entitlement settings for an application.

<span>The Entitlement Settings are added to categories as part of the MediaSpace installation. For other purposes entitlement settings can be added to categories from the Integration Settings page under the Settings tab. </span>

The following sections describe the different setting options available in the Entitlements tab and their impact on end-user entitlements in applications such as MediaSpace.
