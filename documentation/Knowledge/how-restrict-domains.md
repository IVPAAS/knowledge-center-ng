Kaltura’s Access Control mechanism provides the means to restrict content playback from specific domains. This is useful to prevent scraping of content from your website or re-sharing of content on other sites that are not yours.

Domain restrictions allow you to define a “white list” of domains that allow only playback attempts of content placed on these domains to be granted. Any playback attempt via the Kaltura Dynamic Player placed on a domain not on this list will be denied. In the same manner a “black list” can be defined performing the opposite constraint. Any playback attempt from these domains will be denied. You can create a combination of both “white listed” and “black listed” domains.
