<p>
    While creating a Kaltura Webcasting event, you will be prompted to select a publishing option for the Webcasting event. It is recommended that you first create a <strong>private</strong> event and only publish the event after you're done editing it.
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Private</strong> - Media page will be visible to the content owner only.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Unlisted</strong> - Media page will be visible to anyone with a link to the page.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Published </strong>- Media page will be visible to individuals according to entitlements on published destinations; it will also appear in the MediaSpace events page. Selecting this option adds the Categories and Channels selection tabs. <br /><img src="../../assets/2503.img">
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    <br />If you are not sure about the categories and channels you can save the event as Private or Unlisted and return to the event at a later time using the <strong>Publish </strong>button.
