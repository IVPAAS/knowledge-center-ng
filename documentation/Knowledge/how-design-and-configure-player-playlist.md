A playlist is a collection of videos that are grouped together in a particular order for playback in the Kaltura Dynamic Player.   
After you've created your playlist, you can assign your playlist to a player.   
Use the Studio tab to create configurations and design players and playlists.   
You can add, remove and adjust multiple buttons and features, and create a look to match your site.
