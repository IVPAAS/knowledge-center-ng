## <a name="live_reports"></a>Live Reports

The Live Reports tab is enabled in the Analytics section for each KMC account that has Live enabled

Live Reports display how many plays were counted for live entries. The Live Report's display is similar to all the other Kaltura analytics reports.

Plays (for all type of live entries - Kaltura, Akamai, Manual) that are played through the Kaltura player  are counted and displayed at a 1 hour granularity (for example, number of plays at 2pm, number of plays at 3pm, etc.), and are updated every few hours as all of Kaltura analytics are.

The total number of plays is also displayed in the ‘Content > Entries’ tab, and is updated every 24 hours.

### Real time and Historic View of Full Analytics Suite - 3<sup>rd</sup> party Akamai Media Analytics

You may request to enable the Akamai Media Analytics (AMA) plugin on your player. The information that the AMA plugin facilitates is both real-time and contains a historical view of engagement data (for example, plays, visits, etc.) and QoS data (bitrate, buffering, etc.). This information is displayed in the Akamai’s Luna console.

The AMA setup may be configured through Kaltura Support. Contact your Account Manager to enable this feature.

To obtain analytics for a specific event, the AMA setup should be done prior to the event.

### Sending Analytics Events to Third Parties

After you create a Kaltura Player, you can configure third party plug-ins to view analytics information.

### Kaltura Player Supported Plug-ins

The following lists some of the third party plug-ins supported by the Kaltura Player.

*   <a href="http://exchange.kaltura.com/search/luceneapi_node/google%20analytics" target="_blank">Google</a>
*   <a href="http://exchange.kaltura.com/welcome" target="_blank">Omniture </a>
*   <a href="http://exchange.kaltura.com/welcome" target="_blank">Nielson </a>
*   <a href="http://exchange.kaltura.com/search/luceneapi_node/comscore" target="_blank">Comscore</a>

<span class="mce-note-graphic">When you create a player through the <strong>Studio</strong> tab in the KMC, the Kaltura Analytics configuration is automatically included. See the <a href="http://knowledge.kaltura.com/node/1148#configuring_analytics" target="_blank">Universal Studio Infromation Guide</a>.</span>

All other plug-ins must be added manually. For more information about using third party Analytics providers see the section Configuring Third Party Analytics Provider Plug-ins in the Kaltura Management Console User Manual. To learn how to implement a player plugin that sends Analytics data to third-party servers, contact Kaltura.
