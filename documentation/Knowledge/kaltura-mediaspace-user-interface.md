Kaltura MediaSpace 5 (KMS 5) has been redesigned and now implements a responsive web design for optimal user experience across all devices. The MediaSpace User Interface displays differently on each device.  
  


For example, the MediaSpace header on a desktop displays as follows:  
<img src="../../assets/1150.img">

For example, the MediaSpace header on a mobile device displays as follows:  
<img src="../../assets/1149.img">
