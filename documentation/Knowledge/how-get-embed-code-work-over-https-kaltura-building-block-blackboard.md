Media uploaded via one of the following methods should work over HTTPS as expected:

*   Create Item> Mashup Tool> Kaltura Media
*   Tool> Kaltura Media
*   Build Content> Kaltura Media
*   Add Media (KCW/ KSR)

However, media that was uploaded via embed codes (copying the embed code from the KMC and then pasting it to an HTML page via the WYSIWYG in Blackboard) should not work over HTTPS. The media appears as blocked in your browser.

<ul style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <li>
    Mark the "Support for HTTPS embed code" option in the "Preview & embed" window in the KMC before copying the code.
  </li>
</ul>
